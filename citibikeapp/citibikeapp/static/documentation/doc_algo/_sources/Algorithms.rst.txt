Algorithms
***********

A group of algorithms used for rebalence routing

- The greedy heuristic used to determine a tasks' score is a feasible task with the highest (change in disappointed
  customers)/(time required to perform the task) ratio.


Pure Greedy Algorithms
======================
These algorithms use a pure greedy heuristic in order to decide the next move, without any randomness.

.. automodule:: Algorithms
   :members: greedy_best, greedy_iterative, greedy_finish

GRASP Algorithms
================
These algorithms use a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Proceedure in order to decide the next move:

1. Find the top k feasible moves with the highest score
2. Give each of the top k task a probability in proportion to :math:`2^r` where r is equal to its score
3. Randomly select one of the top k tasks using the weighted probabilities

Specified Algorithms
====================
These algorithms generate routes for specific cases.
